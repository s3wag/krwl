# krwl

**krwl** is a simple bash-based automation wrapper designed for bug bounty hunters and penetration testers to perform domain reconnaissance and crawling with ease.

It chains together powerful open-source tools to enumerate subdomains, probe for live hosts, collect URLs and JavaScript files, and extract parameters — giving you everything you need for mapping an attack surface.
